# OVRAU: 
An **O**verall low-dimensional **V**ector **R**epresentations for **A**nchor **U**sers
## Overview 
This directory contains code necessary to run the OVRAU algorithm. OVRAU can be viewed as a graph convolutional neural network based on three candidate aggregator functions incuding mean aggegator, max-pooling aggregator, and LSTM aggregator. It is especially useful for learning latent representations for shared or anchor users across social networks to capture their intra-network and cross network structural information.
